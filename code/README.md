# Project Todo

Todo-List Nina Berggren

This project is a todo app build in React and Redux toolkit. The user can add and remove tasks. I also used customized css and styled components.

## The problem

I started to do some planning of how the app should work, what to place where and some styling ideas on paper. Then I moved on to solve the basic requirements by using steps from lectures for starter code. After that trial and error with small steps each time to be able to trubbleshoot easyer.

If I hade more time I would primarily made my counter work. I would also add cathegories.
